JobApplicationManager
---------------------
This is a simple project I've done for my personal use.

This simple application helps me to manage my job applications by allowing to capture details that are important to me when applying for a new job, updating job application details and to lookup details of a previously applied job.

The application is a Spring Boot application which allows convenient implementation of REST web services. The application has an angular front-end which consumes REST service end points and bootstrap has been used for styling. The database is a light weight H2 embedded db which is sufficient for managing the data requirements of this simple app. It also makes it easy to setup the application.

This is a project I have done to help manage email contacts for a company.

The application allows to upload an email address list (that is pre-formatted in Excel) in to the system, view email contacts in alphabetical order.

Look them up under alphabetically grouped lists. Search, Edit & Delete email contacts as well as to export all contacts into Excel and download.

The application has been implemented using Spring Boot, REST web services, angular 7, Bootstrap & MongoDB.
